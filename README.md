Exploring ideas about using metabolic traits to do genomic selection.

We are working with two main datasets.

- RILs of a B73 x Palomero Toluque√±o BC1S5 mapping population.
- Diversity panel of 120 landraces.

 Both populations where grown side by side in a highland site (Metepec, Edo de Mexico and Valle de Banderas in Nayarit)

In the datasets we have both glycerolipid data and other fitness/morphological traits. A separate file explains the different abreviations used. I have not included the descriptions of the lipid compounds.
